But if you're feeling really down, it's important to talk to someone you trust, like a parent, teacher, or counselor.

Even a short walk can help improve your mood.\n* Eat healthy foods. Eating nutritious foods can give you more energy and help you feel better overall.\n* Get enough sleep. When you're well-rested, you're better able to cope with stress and difficult emotions.\n\nIf you're still feeling down, please reach out for help.
